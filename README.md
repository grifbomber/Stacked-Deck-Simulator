# Stacked-Deck-Simulator
Path of Exile Stacked Deck Simulator

Hi, grifbomber here!

Thank you for trying out my stacked deck simulator! What started out as a "proof of concept" hobby quickly turned into a passion project of mine.

DISCLAIMERS:
- Myself and this project are not affiliated with GGG in anyway
- I am a very novice hobby programmer, mostly self-taught by youTube and Google

Open the simulator by double-clicking the '3.18 Stacked Deck Simulator' application file.

There are buttons at the bottom which will open stacked decks in the amounts of 10, 50, 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000. There is also an entry box just below center that will allow you to open a custom amount of stacked decks. To do this, enter a number in the box below "How many cards?" and click the stacked deck button above it.

There are two modes, non-cumulative and cumulative. Non-cumulative mode will only open the amount of stacked decks in a single button click. Cumulative mode will keep adding to the amount of cards that you have already opened until the 'Clear' button is clicked or the simulator is switched to cumulative mode.

FAQ:
Q: How do we know the drop rates?

A: We don't exactly, but we were able to estimate due to a handful of exiles opening 513,764 stacked decks and submitting their results in 3.18.

Q: Do we have precise drop rates for all divination cards?

A: Unfortunately not. The rarer the card is, the more stacked deck openings that would be required to get a more precise drop rate. This reddit comment can explain statistical caveats much better than I can: https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/wsi0j8/comment/iky95yp/

Q: Why is the simulator as of 3.** when we are currently in patch 3.**?

A: This is due to two things: 1) We don't know if any stacked deck weightings were changed between patch and even if we had a hunch some were changed we don't know what they changed to. 2) New cards are added each patch which we can only guess what the weightings could be.

Q: How can I help?

A: Open stacked decks! Join the Prohibited Library Discord (https://discord.gg/3VxKY6gt7j) and share your results in the stacked-decks channel. Exilence Next is a fantastic tool to track mass stacked deck openings. If you have any questions about that, pop in and ask!
